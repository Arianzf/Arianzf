- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Arian. I have been programming as a hobby since I was 15. I know VB, Python and a little bit of Java,CSS and JS. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in ML or just anything related to AI
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning different python packages that can be used for ML
- I have done projects before. However, I used to be a messy coder for a long time. So I prefer to share my most recent and cleanest projects right now
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
